Yahtzee game project made with React!

Live Demo: https://obscure-castle-49088.herokuapp.com/

This project is part of The Modern React Bootcamp curriculum by Colt Steele.

I had a lot of fun creating this project and adding additional functionalities to it!

It has been a great practice for both React and CSS :)
